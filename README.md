### A collection of HTML projects created as I refresh and redevelop my Front End Developer skills

It has been 13 years since I've received my AS Degrees in Computer Programming & Analysis and Internet Technologies. I originally started my own web design company. I originally started making hand-coded websites and then followed the trend (at least in my area) and started creating, almost exclusively, WordPress driven websites. Sadly, as a small one person company with limited budget I could not compete with the bigger companies and all of the website builders like WIx and SiteBuilder. I've started taking courses and Boot Camps to refresh my skills and learn others with the goal of becoming a Front End Software Developer. MY ultimate goal is to become a Full Stack Developer. 

The projects in this repository are things that I have created as I refresh and re-develop my skills. They might not be perfect, but it's a good starting point!

***Note: I am currently enrolled in the Front End Software Developer Boot Camp offered by Promineo Tech. A seperate repository will be created for that work.***
